				<p><i>&#34;After the birth of my third child, I really struggled with losing weight.  I was 30 lbs heavier than my normal weight and had low energy. <br><br> I started IGNITE Fuel in March and instantly loved it.  My husband started doing it with me too so we were both exercising and eating better.<br><br>  I really like that the workouts are short and easy to fit in to a busy schedule and the food rules helped me to research new ways of cooking and we started eating much healthier.<br><br>  I really like the Facebook page where you can go for encouragement and advice if you have any questions about the program. <br><br> Today I am back into my pre-pregnancy jeans and have lost 25lbs.  I&rsquo;m really thankful to have found this program and feel great.&#34;</i></p>
