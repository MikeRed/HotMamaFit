I made time for my workouts.<br><br> I have NEVER felt this way before. I have even been getting up at 430 am to work out before my dayshifts. UNHEARD of! Working out that early and working a 12 hours day shift, I am not tired! Not once!<br><br>It is amazing. I feel alive. I feel happy. I feel me again. <br><br> Join me.

On top of that, where was I going to find the time and energy to fit this in with a newborn, a toddler, and, well, everything else happening in life.<br><br> The first 2 weeks were HARD! I would wonder after each workout when the &#34;rest day&#34; was coming. Once the half way point came I started noticing a change in my mood, my energy, AND in my waistline!
