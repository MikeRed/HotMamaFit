I strongly believe had it not been for the increased energy I had gotten from just my first two weeks of the program I would not have bounced back as quickly as I did.<br><br> I am now running faster then when I started the 1st round. Speeds I wouldn't dare to attempt prior. I am doing the program this time with heavier weights.<br><br> I'm not always tired. I'm stronger, injury free and I ENJOY my rest day and actually take it off! Lol this is big for me!

I love it so much I throughly educated myself: I received a Bachelor of Physical Education, a Master's of Science and ultimately a PhD in Exercise/Occupational Physiology.<br><br> <b>Yup, I'm Dr. OHM.</b><br><br> My mission is to educate women, show them how to eat healthier, workout harder (safely and effectively) and find that balance of family-life, work and play.<br><br> Most of all I want to help women love. Love themselves. And love one another. I want people to know Hot Mama is a safe place to go no matter where they are in their fitness journey.&#34;</i></p>
