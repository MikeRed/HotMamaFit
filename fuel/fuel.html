		<p>Hi, I am Lindsay Goulet! With obesity on the rise, it is more important than ever to pay attention to the fitness of your family. I believe the best way to ensure your child grows up to lead a healthy, fit life is to first lead by example. We allow you to be that role model for your child while spending important bonding time with them &#45; time they will remember the rest of their lives.</p>
