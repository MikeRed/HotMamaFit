			<p class = "sidemargins"><i>&#34;These 28 days have been AMAZING! The hype of the program definitely delivered. I loved having the program rules, knew exactly what I was doing daily, and loved the PUSH!! (Ohhhhh Lordy the push). <br><br>I love to challenge myself and I've seen huge changes in my strength over the past month. How much more can I lift, can I be better than yesterday?<br><br> Working out makes me a better person. 100%. Hands down it is my therapy.&#34;</i></p>

			<p class = "sidemargins"><i>&#34;I have gained so much more.<br><br>I have become comfortable in my skin. This has taken me my whole life to do.<br><br> I have energy that I have never had in my life. With IGNITE, I woke up energized, I slept through the night, I was energized after my workouts, I ate properly, I drank WATER (yuk), and I craved getting the &#39;me time&#39; in for the workouts. I made time for my workouts.<br><br> I have NEVER felt this way before. I have even been getting up at 430 am to work out before my dayshifts. UNHEARD of! Working out that early and working a 12 hours day shift, I am not tired! Not once!<br><br>It is amazing. I feel alive. I feel happy. I feel me again. <br><br> Join me. I promise you will not regret it. &#34; </i> </p>

			<img class = "testimonial" src = "../images/amanda.jpg" max-width = "100%">
			<p class = "sidemargins"><i>&#34;I was around 12 weeks postpartum. It was the perfect time for me to jump back into a vigorous exercise regime. I felt intimidated starting from what felt like a zero on MY fitness scale. On top of that, where was I going to find the time and energy to fit this in with a newborn, a toddler, and, well, everything else happening in life.<br><br>

			The first 2 weeks were HARD! I would wonder after each workout when the &#34;rest day&#34; was coming. Once the half way point came I started noticing a change in my mood, my energy, AND in my waistline! I was starting to feel like &#34;me&#34;. Talk about adding fuel to my fire.&#34;  </i></p>

I grew up with it.<br><br> I started teaching when I was 17 and have taught from that point on. I love the way the body moves and adapts to exercise. I love it so much I throughly educated myself: I received a Bachelor of Physical Education, a Master's of Science and ultimately a PhD in Exercise/Occupational Physiology.<br><br><b> Yup, I'm Dr. OHM.</b><br><br> My mission is to educate women, show them how to eat healthier, workout harder (safely and effectively) and find that balance of family-life, work and play.<br><br> Most of all I want to help women love. Love themselves. And love one another. I want people to know Hot Mama is a safe place to go no matter where they are in their fitness journey.&#34;</i></p>
