I grew up with it.<br><br> I started teaching when I was 17 and have taught from that point on. I love the way the body moves and adapts to exercise. I love it so much I throughly educated myself: I received a Bachelor of Physical Education, a Master's of Science and ultimately a PhD in Exercise/Occupational Physiology.<br><br> Yup, I'm Dr. OHM.<br><br> My mission is to educate women, show them how to eat healthier, workout harder (safely and effectively) and find that balance of family-life, work and play.<br><br> Most of all I want to help women love. Love themselves. And love one another. I want people to know Hot Mama is a safe place to go no matter where they are in their fitness journey.&#34;</i></p>
