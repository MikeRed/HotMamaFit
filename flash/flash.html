			<p>I've been thrilled with the unexpected side effect of having clearer skin after the first week of the program, and after nearly 4 it just keeps getting better. No more painful breakouts, and the scar tissue is finally healing. I'm getting less self-concious of being in pictures, which has been liberating.</p>

			<img src = "../images/tonya.jpg" width = "550px" height = "550px" max-width = "100%">
			<p>I felt ALIVE again! I strongly believe had it not been for the increased energy I had gotten from just my first two weeks of the program I would not have bounced back as quickly as I did. I am now running faster then when I started the 1st round. Speeds I wouldn't dare to attempt prior. I am doing the program this time with heavier weights. I'm not always tired. I'm stronger, injury free and I ENJOY my rest day and actually take it off! Lol this is big for me! Thank you IGNITE and Thank you Lindsay for allowing me to put forth the best version of myself.</p>

		<p>Hi, I am Lindsay Goulet! With obesity on the rise, it is more important than ever to pay attention to the fitness of your family. I believe the best way to ensure your child grows up to lead a healthy, fit life is to first lead by example. We allow you to be that role model for your child while spending important bonding time with them &#45; time they will remember the rest of their lives.</p>
