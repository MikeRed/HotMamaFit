			<p><i>&#34;I've been thrilled with the unexpected side effect of having clearer skin after the first week of the program, and after nearly 4 it just keeps getting better. No more painful breakouts, and the scar tissue is finally healing.<br><br> I'm getting less self-concious of being in pictures, which has been liberating.&#34;</i></p>

			<p><i>&#34;I felt ALIVE again! I strongly believe had it not been for the increased energy I had gotten from just my first two weeks of the program I would not have bounced back as quickly as I did.<br><br> I am now running faster then when I started the 1st round. Speeds I wouldn't dare to attempt prior. I am doing the program this time with heavier weights.<br><br> I'm not always tired. I'm stronger, injury free and I ENJOY my rest day and actually take it off! Lol this is big for me! Thank you IGNITE and thank you Lindsay for allowing me to put forth the best version of myself.&#34;</i></p>

		<p><i>&#34;They call me the OHM. The "Original Hot Mama."<br><br> My earliest memories are of going with with my own Mama as she taught aerobics in leotards and legwarmers. I grew up with it.<br><br> I started teaching when I was 17 and have taught from that point on. I love the way the body moves and adapts to exercise. I love it so much I throughly educated myself: I received a Bachelor of Physical Education, a Master's of Science and ultimately a PhD in Exercise/Occupational Physiology.<br><br> Yup, I'm Dr. OHM.<br><br> My mission is to educate women, show them how to eat healthier, workout harder (safely and effectively) and find that balance of family-life, work and play.<br><br> Most of all I want to help women love. Love themselves. And love one another. I want people to know Hot Mama is a safe place to go no matter where they are in their fitness journey.&#34;</i></p>
